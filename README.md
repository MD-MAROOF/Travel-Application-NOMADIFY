Hello Everyone !!

🚀 Excited to share my first full-stack project built using the #MERN stack!

 After a lot of hard work and learning, I’ve developed a travel website titled #NOMADIFY inspired by the design and user experience of Airbnb.

🛠️𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, EJS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB


🌐 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
-User authentication and signup
-Users can create and manage their own property listings with detailed information
-Image uploads powered by 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲, a cloud-based media management service
-Interactive map integration using 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐛𝐨𝐱 for dynamic location-based features


🚀𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: The project is live and hosted on Render!

🎥 𝐈’𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝 𝐚 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨 𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐨 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬—𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐭 𝐨𝐮𝐭!

🧭𝐀 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬:
-The site is best viewed on a laptop or desktop—mobile responsiveness is limited as this was a solo learning project.
- The homepage might take sometime to load. If the homepage shows a “𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝” error at first load (Render sometimes sleeps), just click the “Explore” tab and everything will work smoothly. Thanks for your patience! 😊
-The locations and prices listed on the site are placeholder data added for design and learning 
- purposes—they’re not real and were created to experiment with the technology stack.
This project has been an incredible learning experience and a big milestone in my full-stack development journey. Grateful for everything I’ve learned so far and excited for what’s next!

Being my first full-stack application, I know there’s still room for improvement. I'm open to any feedback, suggestions, or reviews—feel free to drop a message in my DMs!
This project marks a major milestone in my journey as a developer, and I’m excited to keep building and learning.
